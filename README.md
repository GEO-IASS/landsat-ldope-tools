#summary Version 1.3.0 of the Landsat LDOPE Toolkit.
== Landsat-LDOPE-Tools Version 1.3.0 Release Notes ==
Release Date: March 2017

### Downloads
landsat-ldope-tools source code

    git clone https://github.com/USGS-EROS/landsat-ldope-tools.git

See git tag [lldope_v1.3.0]

### Dependencies
  * GCTP libraries (obtained from the GCTP directory in the HDF-EOS2 source code)
  * TIFF libraries (3.8.2 or most current) -- ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff/
  * GeoTIFF libraries (1.2.5 or most current) -- ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/geotiff/libgeotiff/
  * HDF4 libraries (4.2.5 or most current) -- https://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF/releases/
  * HDF-EOS2 libraries (2.18 or most current) -- ftp://edhs1.gsfc.nasa.gov/edhs/hdfeos/latest_release/
  * JPEG libraries (version 6b) -- http://www.ijg.org/files/
  * ZLIB libraries (version 1.2.8) -- http://zlib.net/
  * Surface reflectance products generated by LEDAPS or LaSRC (via ESPA) or Landsat OLI L1T products (from GloVis or EE)

NOTE: The HDF-EOS2 link currently provides the source for the HDF4, JPEG, and ZLIB libraries in addition to the HDF-EOS2 library.

### Installation
  * Install dependent libraries - HDF4, HDF-EOS2, TIFF, GeoTIFF, SZIP, ZLIB, JPEG, and GCTP (as delivered with HDF-EOS)
  * Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.  These same environment variables are defined at the top of each Makefile, thus if the environment variables do not exist then they can be defined as appropriate in the Makefile.  If the environment variables are defined and desired to be used, then the user should delete/comment the variables defined in the Makefile.
  ```
    export GCTPINC="path_to_HDF-EOS_GCTP_include_files"
    export GCTPLIB="path_to_HDF-EOS_GCTP_libraries"
    export TIFFINC="path_to_TIFF_include_files"
    export TIFFLIB="path_to_TIFF_libraries"
    export GEOTIFF_INC="path_to_GEOTIFF_include_files"
    export GEOTIFF_LIB="path_to_GEOTIFF_libraries"
    export HDFINC="path_to_HDF_include_files"
    export HDFLIB="path_to_HDF_libraries"
    export HDFEOS_INC="path_to_HDFEOS_include_files"
    export HDFEOS_LIB="path_to_HDFEOS_libraries"
    export SZIPINC="path_to_SZIP_include_files"
    export SZIPLIB="path_to_SZIP_libraries"
    export ZLIBINC="path_to_ZLIB_include_files"
    export ZLIBLIB="path_to_ZLIB_libraries"
    export JPEGINC="path_to_JPEG_include_files"
    export JPEGLIB="path_to_JPEG_libraries"
  ```

  * Checkout (from USGS Github landsat-ldope-tools project) and install source files
  ```
    cd src
    make -f Makefile{_unpack}.{windows|linux}{32|64}
  ```

This will create various executable files under ../bin, depending on which Makefile was used for building.  The user should make sure to utilize the appropriate Makefile for their OS and machine architecture.

### Test 

Download your desired Landsat product(s)(surface reflectance) or OLI L1T from ESPA or GloVis/EE, respectively.  Then run the desired tool for the downloaded Landsat product.

## Release Notes
  * Updated the unpack_oli_qa and unpack_collection_qa tools to read linear 
    units from GeoTIFF tag ProjLinearUnitsGeoKey if it is available and 
    GeogLinearUnitsGeoKey is not available
  * Updated the unpack_oli_qa and unpack_collection_qa tools to be able to 
    read tiled GeoTIFF files.  The outputs will not be tiled
