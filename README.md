#summary Version 1.1.0 of the Landsat LDOPE Toolkit.
== Landsat-LDOPE-Tools Version 1.1.0 Release Notes ==
Release Date: July 2016

=== Downloads ===

* Landsat-LDOPE-Tools source code - available via the [https://code.google.com/p/landsat-ldope-tools/source/checkout Landsat-LDOPE-Tools Google Projects Source] link

=== Installation ===
  # Install dependent libraries - HDF4, HDF-EOS2, TIFF, GeoTIFF, SZIP, ZLIB, JPEG, and GCTP (as delivered with HDF-EOS)
  # Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.  These same environment variables are defined at the top of each Makefile, thus if the environment variables do not exist then they can be defined as appropriate in the Makefile.  If the environment variables are defined and desired to be used, then the user should delete/comment the variables defined in the Makefile.

This will create various executable files under ../bin, depending on which Makefile was used for building.  The user should make sure to utilize the appropriate Makefile for their OS and machine architecture.

  #: Test - Download your desired Landsat product(s)(surface reflectance) or OLI L1T from ESPA or GloVis/EE, respectively.  Then run the desired tool for the downloaded Landsat product.

== Changes From Previous Version ==
* Cleaned up the Makefiles to remove the hard-coded paths to the includes and
  libraries.  The environment variables for the include and library paths are
  specified in this README.
* Modified the unpack_oli_qa to support two GeoKeys for identification of the
  longitude for the Polar Stereographic projection coordinates.
